# Cat_Breed_Classifier
A web-app that asks the user to input the image of a cat, the app then uses a neural network model hosted on a python flask server to predict its breed and then output it to the user.
The whole program uses 2 models overall, out of which one is a pretrained SSD mobile net model, i have used it to check for the presence of a cat in the image that is inputted by the user

The project uses a convolutional neural network to carry out the task.
